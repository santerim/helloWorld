Hello World!
============


Running the program:

Windows/Linux: Go to the location of the file helloWorld.jar with your command prompt/terminal and type:
```
java -jar helloWorld.jar "The string I want to test it with"
```
The .jar file is provided as precompiled and can be found in the root directory of the cloned project.

If you want to compile the files yourself, the easiest way is to create the .jar with an IDE.
Otherwise you need to follow the standard java compile routine using javac and jar tools.
